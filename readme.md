## A bite-sized loadout manager for GTA V.  
Quickly save, clear, and load your loadouts from file. Share .loadout files with your friends and load them with no hassle.  
And of course, there is support for tints, liveries, and components.  
Plus, the "load loadout" list live-updates, so you don't need to restart the script to see the new loadout files. Ever.  
It has never been easier to stay coordinated.

## Install
Drag everything except the readme.md and LICENSE.txt into your Lua Scripts folder. Done and done.

## Installing/deleting loadouts  
Look in Stand/Lua Scripts/store/lance_loadout. Either drag a .loadout file in there, or delete one. Don't touch the files that don't end in .loadout.
